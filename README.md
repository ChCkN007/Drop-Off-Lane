# Drop-Off-Lane
Drop off lane is a tool to help you move photos (or anything) in bulk around your computer faster

This is my first python app, so expect some issues. Between my spagetti code and learning standard practices, I already have a list of possible improvements.

Email me at mattgun04@gmail.com (excuse the email, I made it a while ago) if you find any Bugs or Suggestions.
