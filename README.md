# Drop-Off-Lane
Drop off lane is a tool to help you move photos (or anything) in bulk around your computer faster

HOW TO USE:
To use, extract the .rar file with WinRar and run the .exe

IF THINGS STOP WORKING:
due to some bad error handling most issues can be solved by deleting DropFile.txt

This is my first python app, so expect some issues. Between my spagetti code and learning standard practices, I already have a list of possible improvements.

Email me at mattgun04@gmail.com (excuse the email, I made it a while ago) if you find any Bugs or Suggestions.
